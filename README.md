# Creative Strategies
for whenever you're stuck


I. Capabilities
II. Strategy Submission
  
    You can submit your own strategy through the form at supersecretbanana.com/creativestrategies
    Don't forget to include your name, email, and a link to your site if you want. I will send you
    an email notification on whether your submission has been accepted or rejected.
    
    Submission guidelines:
    
    - Must be a strategy that can be done to help you get past a creative block. This can be any method/technique
    you swear by/ have done/ someone else does.
    
    - You can submit a technique done by someone else and attribute it to them. If you choose to do so, the link should be
    to that particular person and not yourself.
    
    - No NSFW/NSFL stuff. Keep it PG-13 to maintain accessibility for everyone. Submissions that pose any threat to anyone 
    will not be accepted.
    
III. Print CSS

    Each of the strategies can be printed as a mini-poster on regular letter-sized paper. Just click the print this button and
    a printing prompt will appear. Follow your printers guidelines to successfully print the strategy poster which will only
    contain the strategy and its attribution.
    
    When printing through mobile, the text and attribution will be scaled to fit a letter-sized document. The true printed size will
    be much closer to the display on a desktop screen but printing it from any capable device will not change anything. You can also 
    choose to print the mini-posters on colored paper for an additional layer of awesomeness. Just make sure your printer accepts that
    paper.
    
    Laser printers also print type/text better than inkjet printers but it doesn't really change the message of creative motivation 
    the strategies aim to get across. So no worries.
